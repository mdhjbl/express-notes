1.at fisrt for working with express we should download the express module with this command(npm i express )

rout param :
we call the part of link after the constant that changes for each page (Rout param)

type of sending resposnse :
res.send()
res.end()
res.json()
without express when we want to send the resposnse we should set the constent-type but with express
we dont need this 
but whats the difference between them ? the .end() is not very common and most of the time we use .send()
and about .json() it always it the json pattern.

CRUD : create(post) , read(delete) , update(put) , delete(delete)
